To generate the `input.txt` file for the script, you can use Nuclei with the following command:

## Command Syntax:
```
nuclei -l my_domains_list.txt -o input.txt
```

### Explanation:
- **`-l my_domains_list.txt`**: Specifies the input list of domains for Nuclei to scan.
- **`-o input.txt`**: Outputs the results of the scan into the `input.txt` file.

### Steps:
1. Create a file (e.g., `my_domains_list.txt`) containing the list of domains you want to scan.
2. Run the command above to execute the Nuclei scan and generate the `input.txt` file.
3. Use the generated `input.txt` as input for the Python script to extract structured data.

### Example Content in `my_domains_list.txt`:
```
example.com
testsite.com
anotherdomain.org
```

After running the Nuclei command, the `input.txt` file will look like this:
```
[azure-domain-tenant] [http] [info] https://login.microsoftonline.com:443/example/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration ["example-id"]
[laravel-env] [http] [high] https://example.com/.env [paths="/.env"]
[phpinfo-files] [http] [low] https://example.com/phpinfo.php ["8.1.26"] [paths="/phpinfo.php"]
```

This file can then be processed by the script to extract and structure the data.
